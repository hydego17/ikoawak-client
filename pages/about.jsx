          <p>
            My name is Umma Ahimsha, I'm a Front-End developer based in Jakarta,
            Indonesia.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though I spend most of my time writing code for building User
            Interfaces, I've also fiddled around with back-end technologies and
            databases.
          </p>

          <p>
            Back then I used to love books, words and everything in between. If
            you're into literary stuff, feel free to read my poems and proses
            (mostly in Indonesian) in the archive.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can reach me at{" "}
